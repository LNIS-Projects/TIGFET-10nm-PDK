## TIGFET10nm Open Source Predictive Process Design Kit v1.0  [MIT License]

Copyright (c) [2019] [Laboratory for NanoIntegrated Systems]

This is a physical design kit for TIGFET 10nm Silicon Nanowire Device. The design kit is derived using TCAD based device simulations and realistic assumptions made for largescale
production of TIGFET-based systems.

This kit consists of a SPICE model
and full custom physical design files including a Design Rule
Manual, a Design Rule Check, and a Layout Versus Schematic
decks for CalibreÂ®. The repository also hosts implementation of basic logic gates and Full Adder design using TIGFET devices

### TIGFET10nm PDK Directory Structure

* calibre/ -> SVRF rules for Mentor Graphics Calibre
* cdslib/  -> Technology libraires for Cadence Virtuoso
* hspice/  -> Simulation models for Synopsys HSPICE
* docs/    -> Documentation

For more detail about the key assumptions made while designing this PDK, please refer following publication.

### Design Kit Installation and Usage (assuming a csh/tcsh shell)
  1) Clone the github repository.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/LNIS-Projects/TIGFET-10nm-PDK.git
  cd TIGFET-10nm-PDK/
  ```
  
  2) Set the variable PDK_DIR to where the PDK folder is.
  ```bash
  setenv PDK_DIR "$PWD"
  ```
		 
  3) Copy the required user files to where yo uwant to start Virtuoso. It is assumed here that Virtuoso is started in the Github folder itself.
  ```bash
  source $PDK_DIR/cdslib/setup/setup.csh
  ```
     
  Note that this script copies all of the required user files (.cdsinit, cds.lib, and Calibre runset files) to the current working directory if they do not already exist.
	
  4) Source your setup scripts for Cadence Virtuoso, Mentor Graphics Calibre, and Synopsys HSPICE and launch Cadence Virtuoso using the provided script: 
  ```bash 
  launch_tigfet10nm.sh
  ```
