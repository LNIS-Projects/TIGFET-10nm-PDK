## TIGFET10nm Open Source Predictive Process Design Kit v1.0  [MIT License]

Copyright (c) [2019] [Laboratory for NanoIntegrated Systems]

This is physical design kit for TIGFET 10nm Silicon Nanowire Device. The design kit is derived using TCAD based device simulations and realistic assumptions made for largescale
production of TIGFET-based systems.


This kit consists of a SPICE model
and full custom physical design files including a Design Rule
Manual, a Design Rule Check, and a Layout Versus Schematic
decks for CalibreÂ®. Repository also hosts implmentation of basic logic gates and Full Adder design using TIGFET devices

### TIGFET10nm PDK Directory Structure

* cdslib/ -> Technology libraires for Cadence Virtuoso
* calibre/ -> SVRF rules for Mentor Graphics Calibre
* hspice/ -> Simulation models for Synopsys HSPICE
* docs/ -> Documentation

For more detail about the key assumptions made while designing this PDK please refer following publication

[*Ganesh Gore, Patsy Cadareanu, Edouard Giacomin, and Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon "A Predictive Process Design Kit for Three-Independent-Gate Field-Effect Transistors", VLSI-SOC-2019*]()

### Design Kit Installation and Usage

  1) Change to the directory where you want to start Virtuoso and
     source the file $PDK_DIR/cdslib/setup/setup.sh.  Note that
     this script copies all of the required user files (.cdsinit,
     cds.lib, and Calibre runset files) to the current working directory
     if they do not already exist.

  2) Source your setup scripts for Cadence Virtuoso, Mentor Graphics Calibre,     and Synopsys HSPICE and launch Cadence Virtuoso using script *./launch_tigfet10nm*

  ```bash
   cd <Directory_directory>
   $PDK_DIR/cdslib/setup/setup.sh $PDK_DIR
   ./launch_tigfet10nm
   ```
